## Torque 2D Games

### Fill Battle

Source files to the [Fill Battle Tutorial](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque2D/wiki/Fill-Battle-Tutorial). This is a simple board game for 2 players (1 human, 1 computer). Requires development branch build to run properly since ScriptObject behaviors are not available in master branch version 2.0.
